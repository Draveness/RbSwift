RbSwift provides a series of Swift struct/class extension including lots of handy functions with elaborate [API Reference](https://draveness.github.io/RbSwift/).

> Most of the APIs and test cases are from [Ruby Core Libraries](http://ruby-doc.org) and [ActiveSupport](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/activesupport) example.

## Features

+ [x] Transform functions support for `Sequence`, `Array`, and `Dictionary`

    ```swift
    [1, 2, 3, nil, nil, 4, 5, 6, 7]
        .flatten()              //=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
        .select { $0 > 2 }      //=> [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]      
        .reject { $0.isEven }   //=> [3, 5, 7]
        .count                  //=> 3
    ```

+ [x] Built-in `Regex` support for `String` 

    ```swift
    "hello".gsub("l", "abc")    //=> "heabcabco"
    "hello".gsub("l", "lll")    //=> "lllllllllllllll"

    if "hello world" =~ "hello" {
        print("this will match")
    }
    ```

+ [x] Convenient methods build `Date` instance

    ```
    Date.now + 1.day            //=> 2017-01-01 12:00:00 +0000
    2.years + 1.day > 1.year    //=> true
    ```

+ [x] File and IO supports which build on top of low-level C API

    ```swift
    File.basename("/home/work/file.swift") //=> file.swift
    File.open("empty.txt", "w") { file in
        file.write("Content")
    }
    
    Dir.isEmpty("a/empty/folder")   //=> true
    Dir.entries(entriesDir)         //=> [".", "..", "file.swift"]
    
    FileUtils.mkdir_p("draveness/spool/mail") // create folder recursively
    ```

+ [x] Bridge between `NS` to swift type

    ```swift
    let str: NSString = "string"
    "string".bridge         //=> String
    "string".bridge.bridge  //=> NSString
    ```

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate RbSwift into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'RbSwift', '~> 0.5.0'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralised dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate RbSwift into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "Draveness/RbSwift" ~> 0.5.0
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `RbSwift.framework` into your Xcode project.

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. It is in early development, but RbSwift does support its use on supported platforms. 

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding RbSwift as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .Package(url: "https://github.com/Draveness/RbSwift.git", majorVersion: 0)
]
```

### Manually

If you prefer not to use either of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate RbSwift into your project manually.
